The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded.  This often happens when you use asynchronous functions without proper error handling or await statements. For example, if you try to access `snapshot.data().someField` before the promise from `getDoc()` has resolved, you'll encounter a `TypeError` because `snapshot.data()` might still be `undefined`.
