This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Firebase's asynchronous data fetching methods. The `bug.js` file showcases the erroneous code that attempts to access data before it's fully loaded, resulting in a `TypeError`. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version using `async/await` to properly handle the asynchronous operation and prevent the error.  The solution ensures the data is fully loaded before accessing its properties.
